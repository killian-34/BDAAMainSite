                            <h2 style="color: #BB0000">Our History</h2>
                            <p id="history-text" class="text-muted">In November, 2012 the IBM Analytics Solutions Lab opened in Dublin, Ohio providing Columbus with a cutting edge facility in the field of big data. Columbus 2020, the economic development organization for the Columbus region, opened the potential for Columbus to become the next data analytics hub. The spike of data capture in the last few years has started conversations amongst leading local company CEOs. The rise in demand has rendered the need of capable and well-rounded data scientists. We intend to join the conversation by providing quality talent to quality companies.<p>
